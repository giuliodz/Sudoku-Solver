# Sudoku-Solver
Given a certain sudoku in a form of a string, these several classes containing some small algorithms are going to always be able to find a solution (if it exists).

THe header files do the work. Most of the work is done by the classes Sudoku and BreadthFirstSearch. The .cpp files all include these classes and use them to run some tests. So if someone runs them, he will be able to see the positive results.
